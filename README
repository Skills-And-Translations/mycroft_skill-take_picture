Mycroft skill to take pictures using a webcam

this is fork from the rpi-camera-skill.

At the moment, it takes all pictures from the first camera of a list of webcams.


#### Installation

Basicly, you only need pygame.

Under ubuntu i had to do:

sudo apt-get build-dep python-pygame
source ~/.virtualenvs/mycroft/bin/activate
sudo pip install pygame

Raspberry3:
sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev python-numpy subversion libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev 

pip install pygame


#### Config

Unshure if this is working, i found my pictures always under /tmp

mycroft.conf snippit:
  "WebcamPictureSkill": {
    "picture_path": "/home/nold/Pictures",
    "enable_timer": "no",
    "resolution": "1080p"
  }
